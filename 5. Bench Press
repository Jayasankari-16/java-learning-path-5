/* In the gym, Chef prefers to lift at least 
W grams during a bench press and if that's impossible, Chef considers his workout to be incomplete and feels bad.
The rod weighs Wr grams and there are N other weights lying on the floor that weigh w1,w2,...,wN grams. 
To maintain balance and to ensure that there is no unnecessary load due to torque, 
it's important that the weights added to the left side are symmetric to the weights added to the right side. 
It is not required to use all of the weights. It is also not required to use any weights at all, if Chef feels satisfied lifting only the rod.*/
