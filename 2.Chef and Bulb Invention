/* Chef is trying to invent the light bulb that can run at room temperature without electricity.
So he has N gases numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1 that he can use and he doesn't know which one of the N gases will work but 
we do know it.Now Chef has worked on multiple search algorithms to optimize search. For this project, 
he uses a modulo-based search algorithm that he invented himself.
So first he chooses an integerK and selects all indices i in increasing order such that imodK=0 and test the gases on such indices, 
then all indices i in increasing order such that i mod K=1 imodK=1, and test the gases on such indices, and so on.*/
