/* Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared 
p different sets of questions (numbered 0 through p−1), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
The students are assigned roll numbers — pairwise distinct positive integers.If a student's roll number is r, this student gets the ((r−1)%p)-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: A and B respectively.
Find the number of values of p for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values*/
